<img src="/uploads/bethann-zaveson.png" style="float:right;" width="200"/>Too often, organizations assume that if they use a framework like SCRUM or SAFe, they are adopting agile. In reality, agile is improving team efficiencies and leaning out waste. In this conversation, I speak with my colleague John Corcoran about some key elements of what you should be thinking about when adopting agile. -Bill

Many different branches fall under the Agile tree such as SCRUM and the Kanban board. It can be hard to find the right method to go with once you’ve decided to adopt agile methods into your company because what might work for one team might not work for the other leaving clashes of ideas and methodology in its wake. But agile is much more flexible and open to change than we think; the driving force behind agile is to give each person a role and learn where they excel can be most effective and efficient not just from within the team but in terms of how you deliver service to customers as well.

Bill Raymond, founder and CEO of Cambermast, uses workshops and seminars to teach different agile methods to help his clients find the right fit for them all while boosting their productivity and streamlining the creative process.

Join us in this week's episode of Agile in Action as host Bill Raymond gets interviewed byJohn Corcoran of Rise25 about when to use agile methods and how to maintain open communication between teams who follow different methodologies. Tune in as they discuss common mistakes companies make when they try to implement agile, the importance of getting the right people to work in an agile team, and things you need to keep in mind the minute you decide to adapt agile methods into your company.
